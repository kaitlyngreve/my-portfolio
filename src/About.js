                <p>After five years in the cosmetology industry, I was craving a change! After a few months of trying
                    out coding through various resources, I was excited to pursue a career in tech. From there, I attended Flatiron School in their
                    Software Engineer program. I graduated on July 15, 2022.</p>
                <p>I have experience building frontend and backend applications using JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Sinatra.</p>
